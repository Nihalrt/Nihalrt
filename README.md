## About Me

Hey there! I'm Sai Nihal — a passionate computer science student with a drive to build smart, scalable, and meaningful software. I enjoy solving complex problems across the cloud, full-stack development, and AI/ML space. Whether it’s automating a deployment pipeline, analyzing cloud workloads, or crafting intuitive web interfaces — I’m all in.

Currently, I'm diving deep into **AWS, CI/CD, and data engineering**, while experimenting with machine learning applications in cloud environments. I love combining clean code with sharp design and thoughtful engineering.
